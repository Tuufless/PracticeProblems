Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which is length 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", which is length 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", which is length 3. Note that the answer must be
a substring- "pwke" is a subsequence, and not a substring.
